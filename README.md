## üîß Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Linux-based system (Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Raspbian)
- Wireless adapter capable of monitor mode ([supported adapters list](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatible_cards))
- Root/sudo privileges
- aircrack-ng suite

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/benzine12/PI-IDS
   cd PI-IDS/
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Run the installation.py**:
   ```bash
   sudo installation.py
   ```
   This will create an:
   ```bash
      ENV folder
      .env file 
      install requirements.txt
      and generate JWT_KEY in the .env file
   ```

3. **Create a user account** :
   ```bash
   sudo python main.py -c your_username
   ```
   
   > ‚ö†Ô∏è You can skip this if you use the default:
   - **Username**: `admin`
   - **Password**: `admin`

   for production environments, it's strongly recommended to create a new user with a secure password and delete default!

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   sudo python main.py -i wlan0
   ```
   Replace `wlan0` with your wireless interface name capable of monitor mode.

5. **Access the dashboard**:
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## üìã Command Line Arguments

The system supports the following command line arguments:

| Argument | Long Form | Description | Example |
|----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `-c` | `--Create` | Create a new user account | `python main.py -c your_username` |
| `-u` | `--Update` | Update an existing user's password | `python main.py -u your_username` |
| `-d` | `--Delete` | Delete a user account | `python main.py -d your_username` |
| `-i` | `--Interface` | Specify the wireless interface to use | `python main.py -i wlan0` |
| `-h` | `--Help` | Display help information | `python main.py -h` |

## üõ°Ô∏è Attack Detection Techniques

WIDS employs sophisticated detection techniques for various wireless threats:

### 1. Deauthentication Attacks

**What it is**: Attackers send spoofed deauthentication frames to disconnect legitimate clients from their APs, potentially forcing them to reconnect to rogue APs.

**Detection Method**: WIDS analyzes temporal patterns in deauthentication frames, looking for:
- Multiple frames sent in rapid succession
- Consistent time intervals between frames (suggesting automated tools)
- Frames sent to broadcast addresses or specific clients

**Implementation**: `DeauthDetector` class in `modules.py`

### 2. Probe Request Scanning

**What it is**: Attackers use tools to send numerous probe requests for different SSIDs to discover hidden networks and gather information about nearby APs.

**Detection Method**: WIDS monitors:
- Volume of probe requests from a single source
- Number of unique SSIDs being requested
- Time pattern of probe requests
- Flags devices that exceed configurable thresholds

**Implementation**: `ProbeScannerDetector` class in `modules.py`

### 3. Beacon Spam Attacks

**What it is**: Attackers flood the airwaves with fake beacon frames advertising non-existent APs to confuse wireless clients and tools.

**Detection Method**: WIDS analyzes:
- Beacon frame frequency from a specific source
- Number of unique SSIDs being advertised
- Temporal patterns of beacon transmission
- Flags sources exceeding normal beacon rates

**Implementation**: `BeaconSpamDetector` class in `modules.py`

### 4. Rogue AP Detection

**What it is**: Unauthorized access points set up to mimic legitimate networks, often used for man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Detection Method**: WIDS compares detected APs against a database of known legitimate APs, checking:
- BSSID (MAC address) discrepancies
- ESSID (network name) matches with different security settings
- Unusual configurations or unexpected security changes

**Implementation**: `is_rogue_ap()` function in `main.py`

### 5. Karma Attacks

**What it is**: Advanced rogue AP attacks where the attacker's AP responds to any probe request, mimicking whatever network a client is looking for.

**Detection Method**: WIDS looks for:
- APs that respond to multiple different probe requests
- High volumes of probe responses from a single source
- Matching SSIDs with different security configurations

**Implementation**: Integrated with rogue AP detection in `main.py`

## üß™ Testing the Detection System

The repository includes attack simulation tools to test and validate detection capabilities:

### Beacon Spam Testing

Tests the system's ability to detect beacon flooding attacks:

```bash
cd backend/tests
sudo python beacon_spam_test.py wlan0mon
```

### Probe Scanner Testing

Tests the system's ability to detect aggressive network scanning:

```bash
cd backend/tests
sudo python probe_scanner_test.py wlan0mon
```

> **IMPORTANT**: Always use a different wireless interface for testing than the one WIDS is monitoring. For example, if WIDS is monitoring `wlan0`, use `wlan1` for testing.

## üéÆ User Interface Guide

### Dashboard

The main dashboard provides:
- Real-time packet activity graph
- Threat detection graph
- System resource utilization
- Comprehensive table of detected attacks
- Options to resolve/acknowledge threats

### AP Scanner

The AP scanning view shows:
- List of all detected access points
- Signal strength and channel information
- Security information (encryption type)
- Option to add APs to protected list
- Band distribution statistics (2.4GHz vs 5GHz)

### Themes

You can switch between light and dark themes using the toggle in the top navigation bar.

## üîç Advanced Configuration

You can modify detection thresholds and behaviors by editing the corresponding classes in `modules.py`:

- `DeauthDetector`: Configure deauthentication attack detection sensitivity
- `ProbeScannerDetector`: Adjust probe request scanning thresholds
- `BeaconSpamDetector`: Modify beacon spam detection parameters
